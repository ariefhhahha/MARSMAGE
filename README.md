# myUnityProject MARSMAGE
Created : 2018

this is the project of my thesis on my bachelor degree.

this is a simple basic math operation.
and very basic augmented reality game.

i'm using vuforia in this project just for gyro sensor.

there will be a box with a math quiz on its side (front, back, right, and left).
few seconds after the quiz appeared, 4 balls will come out from top of the box.
each ball has a different answer and just one ball that has the right answer.

player has to shoot the ball that has right answer.

all assets except sounds and musics are made by me.
